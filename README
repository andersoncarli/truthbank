Hello World, my name is Anderson Carli, I'm a Brazilian software engineer and neophyte writer. 

I'm hearing some proeminent voices of the AI community calling to stop or pause the AI development fearing its progress.

Should it be stoped? I dont think is possible anymore. The genie is already is out of the bottle and cannot fit on it again. 

So, instead of talking about a improblable develpment pause, lets talk about a secure plan to get better AIs based on a bedrock called Truth.

What follow is the the magnun opus of my life. A somewhat orgarnized knowled base of my memories and insighits. 

It is a mix of technical book with an autobiographical narrative, a collection fo insights, knowledge notes and chronicles and memories, as well dreams and fantasy. 
As I never could really separate this things in my mind, I bring all mixed in free association. 

Please take everything with a grain of salt with critical mind, it was written by a delusion prone human, assisted by a allucinatory AI. =) 

I hope you you find it interestingly and valuable. I will do my best to make it enternaing and informative. All corrections and colaboration is welcome.

# The TruthBank - The quest for Finding the Universal Truths.

This book aims to lay down the foundations of a new knowledge system to ideintify, collect and cristalize *universal truths* based on the following four pillars:

1. The 64 universal concepts of the Iching - The book of Changes
2. The Aristotelian epistemology and the square of opposition
3. The Bayesian Networks and the incremental gain of knowledge
4. The Transformer Neural network

Trough this book I will tie some connections between this toughts systems, aiming to produce a solid strating point for a new kind of AI: A Truth oriented one. 

Using a logical and philosofical perspective aiming a practical definition, appliable in the current context of current the Artificial Inteligence development state.

## Preamble - My Trip to Here

It was September 22, 2011. I waked up at morning and my wife said she was tired and will not work on that day. (A thing she never did before) So I decided go to a near bakery buy some stuff to the breakfast. 

My dog, the family pet, 3 years old pintcher, seen me preparing to go outside came happily in my direction asking for a walk. So I obeyed it, and grab the collar and the rope. He was called Walle because it was a little trash eater.

Outside, I walked with him in the hope, until we get into the marginal bike lane of a road, beeing a safe place we are used to walk, I released it to piss in a near sugar canes bush. I had developed a kind of telepatic relation with him. Where every hand movent was undertood. It was trained to running or stoping allways by my side. 

But on that day, I made a sad mistake. Instead walk with him until the end of the block at the pedestrian crossing as he was trained, I unconsciouly decided to jaywalk and cross the road in the midle of the block. Waiting for the dog, I stoped beween two parked cars, and called it: Walle came! 

That little bastard, came in my direction as a rocket, and didn't stopped besides me as usual, but instead confused the two parked cars as a safe tunnel run rightly to the movimented street, in the exact moment a bus was passing in high velocity. The timing was so precise that I believe that the bus driver seen what hapend. But I saw everyting. 

My little friend, beeing hit by the front of the bus, getting up and starting to come back, because he has shortet then the bus lower height, just to meet the back wheel of the bus.

After the shock, yet not believing on was just happed, I rapidly go to him, and grab it from the ground. His already unconscios body with a smashed head hung inert on my hands. His blood ran down my forearms and I could somewath feel its vital force cushioning my arms.

I never forget that day, ironicaly the "World Car Free Day", and my dog was hit by a bus. Then, I hide the body behind a bush, and walked back home, to tell the sad news to my family.

After the general shock, I got a gift box that fit him and his beloved companion a old stuffed moose, he hijacked from my daughter and came back to grab him. 

In the next days after his burial, the bike lane alone without my little friend, I feel like something had changed on me. 

Before that I was leaving a shit of life, feeling locked on a relationship of "incompatible happines" where what makes on happy dont makes the other and vice versa. I was depressed, after a professional burnout, unemployed, on the verge of a divoce under medication and often thinking about suicide as an alternative. 

But then, somehow the voluntary sacrifice of that dog, left me a gift: A overhelming sense of compassion all the beings and for the life I never experienced. The proximity of the death  brings me the love for the life. I got the religious meaning of the sacrifice.

Walking the byke lane alone without my little friend, I learned to transmute to sorrow in gratitude, so everytime I remembered him, I remembered a previous moment we passed that point of the track and smiled. 

That experienc bringing me a new view of the life and about what really matters on it. With that a somewhat renewed view I got a new job and decided to start again.

From my cubicle, as the seconds was passing I started to count the seconds until the iconic time stamp 11/11/11 11:11:11.
I looked to my coworkers and said: The world is not over... yet! and look back to my screen, tring to solve the thing they was paying me to.

At that time I did not know what the live has reserved to me, my new journey was just begining, and my life was near of a new plot twist

# Preface

> Two plus two
> Rodrigo couldn't understand why he needed to learn mathematics, since his pocket calculator would perform all the calculations for him, for the rest of his life. So the teacher decided to tell a story.
> She told the story of the Supercomputer. One day, she said, all the computers in the world would be unified into a single system, with its center in some city in Japan. Every home, every place in the world would have terminals connected to the Supercomputer. People would use it for shopping, messaging, booking flights, and seeking advice on personal matters. For everything. No one would need individual watches, books, or portable calculators anymore. There would be no need to study. Everything anyone would want to know about anything would be stored in the Supercomputer's memory, accessible to all. In a fraction of a second, the answer to any query would appear on the nearest screen. And there would be billions of screens scattered wherever people might be, from public restrooms to space stations. All one would have to do is press a button to obtain the desired information.
> One day, a boy would ask his father:
> - Dad, what is two plus two?
> - Don't ask me, ask Him - the father would reply.
> - And the boy would press the appropriate buttons, and in a split second, the answer would appear on the screen. Then the boy would say:
> How do I know the answer is correct?
> - Because He said it's correct - the father would respond.
> - What if He's wrong?
> - He's never wrong.
> - But what if He is?
> - We can always count on our fingers.
> - What?
> - Count on our fingers, like the ancients did. Raise two fingers. Now two more. See? One, two, three, four. The computer is right.
> - But, dad, what about 362 times 17? We can't count that on our fingers. Not unless we gather a lot of people and use their fingers and toes. How can we be sure His answer is correct? What if the Computer is lying?
> Rodrigo liked the story, but he said that when no one knew to do math (and critical thinking) anymore and couldn't put the Computer to the test, it wouldn't make a difference whether the Computer was right or not, since its answer would be the only one available and, therefore, the correct one, even if it was wrong, so...
> Then the father sighed and said: 
> - My son, we may never know...
> Then it was the teacher's turn to sigh.

A motivatinal is a tale from the Brazilian write Luiz Fernando Veríssimo, about the credibility of an AGI. 

Could we trust it? How could we resolve the allucinations of the current AIs giving them a solid natural fundation scafold already defined by the IChing Universal concepts as compartments of a 3d matrix to reference and index similar concepts.
