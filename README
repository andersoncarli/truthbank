## Introduction

TruthServer is a web application that allows users to submit logical statements and propositons and receive a credibility score for that statement. it is the practical application of the [TruthBank](./BOOK) project/book. Using a custom implementation of a Bayesian truth testing algorithm to calculate the credibility. Or a random one working as a oracle at user will.

The algorithm works by breaking down each statement into its sub-propositions or premises and assigning prior probabilities to each sub-proposition based on the quantifier used in the statement. It then uses evidence from previously submitted premises to update the probabilities of each sub-proposition and calculates the conditional probability of each sub-proposition being true given the updated evidence.

The credibility score of the statement is then calculated as the product of the negated conditional probabilities of each sub-proposition. The less likely a statement can be denied, the lower is its truthfullness. The opposite way, the most controversial is the statement and most negative it faces, it will less likely to be true. meaning that the proper context should be defined, with a proper chain of premises.

## Getting Started
To get started with TruthServer, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Then, install the dependencies by running the following command:

    npm install
Once the dependencies are installed, start the server by running the following command:

    npm start

The server will start listening on port 3000 by default. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to access the application.

## Usage
To use TruthServer, enter a logical statement in the text input field on the home page and click the "Submit" button. The application will calculate the credibility score of the statement and display it on the result page.

You can also add premises to the knowledge base by clicking the "Add Premise" button on the home page and entering a logical statement in the input field that appears. The application will use the premises to update the probabilities of sub-propositions in future statements.
